        A bone marrow transplant is a medical procedure performed to replace bone marrow that has been damaged or destroyed by disease, infection, or chemotherapy. This procedure involves transplanting blood stem cells, which travel to the bone marrow where they produce new blood cells and promote growth of new marrow.

        Bone marrow transplants are used to treat patients with conditions such as leukemia, lymphoma, and other blood cancers. They may also be used to treat other types of cancer, as well as other blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.
