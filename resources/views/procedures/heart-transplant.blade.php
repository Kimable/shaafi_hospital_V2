      A heart transplant is a surgical procedure performed to remove a damaged or diseased heart and replace it with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. Heart transplants are used to treat end-stage heart failure, a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

      Heart transplants are typically recommended for patients with severe heart failure who have not been able to improve their condition with other treatments, such as medication, lifestyle changes, or other types of surgery. Heart transplants are considered a last resort treatment option for patients with end-stage heart failure.
