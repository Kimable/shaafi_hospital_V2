      <p>
        Gastric bypass surgery is a type of weight loss surgery that involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the intestines to bypass a portion of the small intestine. This procedure reduces the amount of food you can eat and the number of calories your body absorbs, resulting in weight loss.

        Gastric bypass surgery is used to treat patients with severe obesity who have not been able to lose weight through diet and exercise alone. It is typically recommended for patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher, or a BMI of 35 or higher with obesity-related health conditions such as type 2 diabetes or sleep apnea.
