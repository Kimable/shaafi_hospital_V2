        A biopsy is a medical procedure performed to remove a small sample of tissue from a suspicious area of the body. The tissue sample is then examined under a microscope to determine if it is cancerous or benign. Biopsies are used to diagnose many different types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and skin cancer.

        There are several different types of biopsies, including needle biopsies, surgical biopsies, and endoscopic biopsies. The type of biopsy you receive will depend on the location of the suspicious area and the size of the tissue sample needed.

        Our team of pathologists, radiologists, and surgeons work together to provide the best possible care for patients undergoing biopsies. We offer a wide range of biopsy options, including fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and excisional biopsy.
