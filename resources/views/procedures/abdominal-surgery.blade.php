      <p>
        Abdominal surgery is a type of surgery that involves the organs in the abdomen, including the stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, and appendix. Abdominal surgery may be performed to treat a variety of conditions, including cancer, infection, and injury.
      </p>
     <p>
        Abdominal surgery may be performed using minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy, or using traditional open surgery. Minimally invasive surgery is often associated with faster recovery times, less pain, and reduced scarring compared to open surgery.
